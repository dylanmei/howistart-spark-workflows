Working with distributed systems can be challenging. The creative process of authoring solutions should not be blocked due to unavailable infrastructure. With Docker and Docker Compose we can get going with little fuss, iterating on our ideas well before going to production.

The project is part of a talk that demonstrates sketching out an idea in Zeppelin, building out that idea in Spark, and executing it on both a local Spark standalone cluster and a Mesos cluster. The repo contains three core parts:

- zeppelin
- spark standalone
- spark on mesos
